# Hosting Options for MCP Calorie Tracker

## Overview
The MCP server needs to be accessible from anywhere (not just localhost) to work with Claude and other chat agents. Key requirements:
- WebSocket support for MCP protocol
- HTTPS for secure connections
- Persistent storage for SQLite database
- Reasonable uptime for personal use

## Option 1: Home Server

### Pros
- Complete control over hardware and software
- No monthly hosting fees
- Data stays on your own hardware
- Can use existing computer/Raspberry Pi

### Cons
- Need to handle dynamic IP or get static IP
- Security concerns with exposing home network
- Uptime depends on home internet/power
- Need to manage SSL certificates

### Setup Requirements
1. **Dynamic DNS Service** (DuckDNS, No-IP)
   - Maps dynamic home IP to stable domain
   - Free options available
   
2. **Port Forwarding**
   - Forward port 443 (HTTPS) to server
   - Configure router firewall rules
   
3. **Reverse Proxy** (Nginx/Caddy)
   - Handle SSL termination
   - WebSocket proxy support
   - Automatic Let's Encrypt certificates
   
4. **Security Hardening**
   - Fail2ban for brute force protection
   - API key authentication
   - Firewall rules
   - Regular security updates

### Example Setup with Tailscale
- Use Tailscale for secure access without port forwarding
- Access server via Tailscale network from anywhere
- No public internet exposure
- Built-in encryption

## Option 2: VPS (Virtual Private Server)

### Providers
- **DigitalOcean**: $4-6/month droplets
- **Linode**: Similar pricing to DO
- **Hetzner**: EU-based, very competitive pricing
- **Vultr**: Good global coverage

### Pros
- Full control over environment
- Static IP included
- Professional uptime
- Can host multiple services

### Cons
- Monthly cost
- Need to manage server security
- Responsible for backups
- More complex setup

## Option 3: Platform-as-a-Service

### Free/Low-Cost Options

**Fly.io**
- Free tier with 3 shared VMs
- Built-in SSL
- Good for small apps
- Persistent volumes for SQLite

**Railway**
- Simple deployment
- Free trial credits
- WebSocket support
- Volume storage available

**Render**
- Free tier available
- Automatic SSL
- Persistent disks (paid)
- Good DX

### Pros
- Managed infrastructure
- Automatic SSL
- Easy deployment from GitHub
- Built-in monitoring

### Cons
- Less control
- Potential cold starts on free tiers
- Storage costs extra
- Vendor lock-in

## Option 4: Serverless + Cloud Storage

### Architecture
- AWS Lambda/Vercel Functions for API
- AWS RDS/PlanetScale for database
- WebSocket via AWS API Gateway

### Pros
- Scales to zero
- Pay per use
- High availability

### Cons
- Complex MCP WebSocket handling
- Higher latency
- More expensive at scale
- Not ideal for SQLite

## Option 5: Container Hosting

**Google Cloud Run**
- Serverless containers
- Scales to zero
- Persistent storage via Cloud SQL

**AWS App Runner**
- Similar to Cloud Run
- Automatic scaling
- Container-based

## Recommendation for Your Use Case

Given the requirements:
1. **For Simplicity**: Start with Fly.io or Railway
   - Easy deployment
   - Free tier sufficient for personal use
   - SQLite-friendly with persistent volumes
   
2. **For Control**: Home server with Tailscale
   - No ongoing costs
   - Complete privacy
   - Easy setup with Tailscale

3. **For Reliability**: Small VPS ($5/month)
   - Professional uptime
   - Full control
   - Can grow with needs

## Quick Start Path

1. **Local Development First**
   - Get everything working locally
   - Test with Claude Desktop
   
2. **Tailscale for Remote Access**
   - Install Tailscale on dev machine
   - Access from anywhere securely
   - No port forwarding needed
   
3. **Deploy to Fly.io**
   - When ready for "production"
   - Simple deployment
   - Minimal configuration

## Security Considerations

Regardless of hosting choice:
- Always use HTTPS
- Implement API key authentication
- Regular backups of SQLite database
- Monitor access logs
- Keep dependencies updated
